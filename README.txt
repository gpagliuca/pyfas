Pyfas - FA tools
===========

Pyfas provides python tools for a flow assurance engineer.
Typical usage often looks like this::

    #!/usr/bin/env python

    tpl = Tpl(fname)
    d, m = tpl.extract(1)

(Note the double-colon and 4-space indent formatting above.)

Paragraphs are separated by blank lines. *Italics*, **bold**,
and ``monospace`` look like this.


A Section
=========

Lists look like this:

* First

* Second. Can be multiple lines
  but must be indented properly.

A Sub-Section
-------------

Numbered lists look like you'd expect:

1. hi there

2. must be going

Urls are http://like.this and links can be
written `like this <http://www.example.com/foo/bar>`_.
